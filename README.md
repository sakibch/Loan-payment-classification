# classification-project
**This project aims to build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.**

Historical datasets will be used from previous loan application. The data will be cleaned and then different classification algorithms will be used on the data.
The following algorithms will be used to build the models:

k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics:

Jaccard index, F1-score, LogLoss.
